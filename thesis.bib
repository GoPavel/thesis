  abstract     = {...The first part of this thesis explores generic extensions of KA and KAT with
                  extra equational assumptions. Such extensions are meant to capture in the context
                  of program verification some crucial properties of the domain of computation. We
                  present a very general completeness meta-theorem that instantiates into several
                  useful concrete completeness results. The second part focuses on extensions of KAT
                  with extra mutable state that enable many useful semantics-preserving program
                  transformations. The transformations we intend to cover are motivated by classical
                  examples from the area of program schematology. We offer a rigorous and
                  mathematically appealing algebraic approach, which replaces the typical
                  combinatorial arguments about flowchart schemes with equational reasoning.
                  Finally, a typed variation of KA is investigated that intends to capture
                  properties of mathematical structures that appear in domain theory. The main
                  result is that our proposed typed KA with products is strong enough to establish
                  all the abstract properties of parametric fixpoints in the standard semantic model
                  CPO, which is the category of [omega]-CPOs and [omega]-continuous maps.},

                  deciding the equivalence of Kleene algebra terms within the Coq proof assistant.
                  The algorithm decides equivalence of two given regular expressions through an
                  iterated process of testing the equivalence of their partial derivatives and does
                  not require the construction of the corresponding automata. Recent theoretical and
                  experimental research provides evidence that this method is, on average, more
                  efficient than the classical methods based on automata. We present some
                  performance tests, comparisons with similar approaches, and also introduce a
                  generalization of the algorithm to decide the equivalence of terms of Kleene
                  algebra with tests. The motivation for the work presented in this paper is that of

                  for the problem if a regular expression with intersection describes a non-empty
